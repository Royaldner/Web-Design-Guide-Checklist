# WEB DESIGN GUIDE CHECKLIST by Maddie Nieman

## **Phase 1: Design Setup**

> 🎨 *Starting the right way makes for a strong finish. The better you prep your files the smoother the entire process will be developing in Webflow. Trust me & thank me later.*

- [ ] Use an existing “Starter Template” or create your own in **Figma or Adobe XD** with a clear style guide before designing the rest of your site.
    - I love to use Relume’s Starter Figma Kit: [FREE VERSION](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1078092050664989246)
- [ ] Update the style guide with the client’s branding. Add colors & update typography styles. Add logos or design assets.
- [ ] Design your freaking awesome website 💻 ✨
- [ ] Share your designs with the client for feedback & approval.
- [ ] Export your web assets like images, logos, icons etc.
    - Use SVG for vector graphics.
    - Use png or jpg for photos.
- [ ] Optimize all images & reduce file size to be less than 500kb. Use the links below.
    - [IloveIMG.com](https://www.iloveimg.com/)
    - [Tinyjpg.com](http://tinyjpg.com)
- [ ] Organize all your assets in folders by page (or whatever works best for your 🧠).

## **Phase 2: Webflow Set Up**

> 🤔 *This step is about setting up your Webflow site the right way to make the transfer from design to live website much easier.*

- [ ] Decide on the class naming system you’d like to use (I always use [Finsweet’s Client-First](https://finsweet.com/client-first)).
- [ ] Duplicate or clone a ‘Starter Template’ in Webflow that already has your preferred classes & style guide set up.
    - I start all projects with [the Relume Cloneable](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/relume-library-styleguide?ref=made-in-webflow-search&searchValue=relume), which uses the Client-First Naming system 👍 BIG FAN.
- [ ] Upload brand fonts in site settings panel (Google, Adobe, or custom).
- [ ] Turn off “made in webflow” badge under general settings.
- [ ] In the Designer, update the style guide page with your branding.
- [ ] Update global colors and any global classes first (ie. ‘All H1 Headings’).
- [ ] Upload image & icon assets you know you will need.

## **Phase 3: Webflow Build**

> 💻 *Great. Your style guide is set up & you're ready to start building your pages. Personally, I like to use my checklist for each individual page to clean up my work as I go. Duplicate the toggle checklist below for as many pages as you need, or use 1 checklist for all pages at the very end.*

### **Home Page Checklist** (duplicate this for each of your site’s pages)
